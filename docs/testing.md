# Testing

How ear is tested: the rules every test follows, and what each test program proves. The commands
that build and run them are in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md#build-run-and-test).

## The rules

- **Tests are event-gated.** A test waits for the event it needs (a record ear prints, a
  notification, a link going active, a thread's answer); a deadline only fails a test, never
  decides when something happens. A sleep that stands in for an event is a bug.
- **Audio is verified here, never on real hardware.** The engine runs in-process with no daemon,
  so the tests read samples, stamps and WAV files exactly. Hardware checks (the MOTU 24Ao, a real
  Music Assistant) are listed as owed in the skills, never run in CI.
- **A failing test fails; nothing is skipped.** The all-type tests fail naming a type that lacks
  what they need, a CTest test that matches no test case fails, and a guard that would check no
  file fails.
- **Timing tests need a data thread that keeps time.** The engine, ramp, RTP and `sendspin` clock
  tests fail without a bug when a heavily loaded host stalls PipeWire's data thread for hundreds of
  milliseconds (graph xruns): rerun such a failure alone before suspecting the code
  ([engine.md](engine.md#xruns-on-a-loaded-host-are-not-bugs)).
- **A test makes the rare event it needs; it never waits for the host to.** What a host does by
  chance (a graph xrun, a cut-short cycle) comes at very different rates on different machines, so
  a test that needs it brings it about itself and requires the count it planned; what the host adds
  is counted with it, never required. S5 cuts its cycles short by sleeping past the cycle inside a
  probe's `process` ([engine.md](engine.md#the-one-data-loop-and-invokes)); a load of its own, as
  S5's busy thread per core, only adds evidence.

## How the suites are built

Catch2 v2 (`vendor/catch`). Each package has one test executable, and `ear_catch_tests`
(`test/CMakeLists.txt`) makes each test case its own CTest test with `catch_discover_tests` and
Catch's `--warn NoTests`, so `ctest --parallel` runs them side by side. Keep `;` out of test names:
CMake splits a name at it. A test case whose load would starve the realtime-timed tests beside it
is named by tag in `ear_catch_tests(<target> SERIAL <tag>)`, which gives it CTest's `RUN_SERIAL`
(only the `[s2]` spikes in `ear_pipewire_tests`: S2 and S5). `test/main.cpp` turns off Catch's
POSIX signal handlers, which do not compile against glibc 2.34 and newer (Catch 2.13.5 fixes it).

Beside the executables, `test/CMakeLists.txt` runs `ear --help` (the binary loads its shared
libraries), `ear_carried_patch_check` runs what configure asks of a tree that must carry a patch,
`ear_engine_conf_beside_ear` checks that the copy of `engine.conf` beside the binary matches
the source, and `ear_doc_example_*` take the worked example out of
[writing-a-node-type.md](writing-a-node-type.md#worked-example-tone) and compile it against today's
headers.

## What each test program proves

| Executable | What it proves |
|---|---|
| `ear_core_tests` | Port banks and whole port names; the desired graph's checks, plan and commit (event order, a port change as a replacement, stale plans), observer order, closing; the node lifecycle's machines by table (every event in every state, every operation in every phase); `NodeHost` over fake adapters: restart, removal, sound cards and RTP receivers in either order, a lost block, the two-phase start, one name per engine object, the pass-through, a class's `start()` and `stop()` paired, a hook that throws, `ear.hook-slow`, every rule a type breaks failing its node `start-failed` even when the type catches it, the interim sink (begun before the node is configured, never faded, bound by every drive and no silence), each companion's readiness deadline on the fake clock (its kind's text and code, a ready first wins, a restart's own), latency plans, runs with threads, and the teardown rules (the barrier first, a consumer blocked at teardown, a late write from an old run, a run leaked past the close deadline); `FrameRing`; the latency model by table (series and `Paths` apart, no path apart from zero, one row per bank shape and per past regression: a wrapped chunk's second call, a pair's declared delay reaching its input's told latency, a companion's `beyond` in series with peers reporting zero, parallel peers' least and most, rate conversion; a plan that does not fit its ports refused); the reconciler; levels; the graph read; card ids and RTP addresses; settings tables; the type interface through the harness. Pure, milliseconds |
| Compile-fail tests (`src/core/tests/compile_fail/`) | What must not compile is refused for its reason: `settings_table_bad.cpp` (a bad row, a misspelt or unlisted row, an unchecked read of an optional row, a type that disagrees with its table or folder) and `type_spec_bad.cpp` (a bank the spec lacks, a write into an input, a class of the wrong shape, a call `CreateOf` does not offer, a resource on the wrong bank, a spec in an unnamed namespace, and more) and `latency_bad.cpp` (a `Delay`, such as a companion's buffer, added to `Paths` as a peer, or passed off as a path). 89 cases, each running the compiler: the slow part of the suite (about 230 s summed at `JOBS=4`). They match GCC 14's wording, so a compiler bump may need their regexes edited |
| `ear_folder_tests` | The confined folder on real temporary folders: made if missing (never its parents), `create()` beneath only, `read()` and `replaceIf()` refusing symlinks, directories, FIFOs, large files and paths out, replace-if-unchanged keeping the file's mode, a new file's mode under any umask, `restrictMode()`, a folder it cannot write, an inotify watch, `requireApart()` |
| `ear_node_white_tests`, `ear_node_file_tests`, `ear_node_card_tests`, `ear_node_rtp_tests` | Each type through `TypeHarness`, by its spec's bank handles: settings and each refusal's text, ports, the resources its `configure` asks for, readiness and loss, stop, start and restart, and what its code or the pass-through carries. `file` runs over a real recordings folder: exact samples, every cycle the code drove and none while stopped, a restart finishing one WAV and opening the next, paths that lead out refused |
| `ear_node_sendspin_tests` | The feed on real threads, PCM, the audio code's clock and skips, the connection watch on fake time, settings, key files on a real folder, port claims and the probe, the transport's share per address, the mDNS name and on-link check, peer text on a status line, the notes' rate; through a real engine and the real Sendspin server, the clock within 1 ms on the dummy driver and through a following test card |
| `ear_node_types_tests` | What holds for every type, taken from the generated list as `main.cpp` takes it: a folder makes one type of its name, each type's settings table and every refusal's text and order (`test/nodes/settings_refusals_test.cpp`), and every type but those in `notYetInHarness` run through the harness (configured, running once its companions are ready, every output sample written, stopped, started, restarted, disabled, enabled, removed). Also, as CTest tests: configure refuses one node type linking another in each spelling, and an empty list of types; and no file under `src/nodes/` writes standard output or error (`test/nodes/standard_output_guard.cmake`, itself tested) |
| `ear_output_tests` | The output thread on real pipes (order, a reader that does not read refused at once, everything written at stop); the capture of descriptors 1 and 2 in its own test program; a crash's last words in forked children; the main-loop watchdog on a clock stepped by hand and on a real stall |
| `ear_control_tests` | The JSON-RPC envelope (the specification's examples), commands, events, the graph file's types, every standard-output record field for field against `output-records.json` (drops, pacing, bad UTF-8, one order from many threads), the lifecycle's wire, gateway and sessions, all against `test/protocol` |
| `ear_config_tests` | The graph file model (each of ear's codes at its place, `@include`, missing and unreadable files), places in UTF-16 columns, edits at the source, `disabled`, the lifecycle verbs' mapping to the wire; the keeper's sequencer stepped by hand over a real folder (accepted and refused edits, both hand-edit collisions, `graphFile.set`, batches, write failures, pending restart, stop); the keeper's thread and the whole keeper with inotify |
| `ear_pipewire_tests` | The real in-process engine with no daemon, runtime directory or D-Bus: blocks process unrouted, live ports, a ramp carried sample for sample, the clock and each cycle's `GraphCycle`, latency per bank pair, denormals, teardown, SIGTERM; the legacy handoff and the interim sink (order, stamps, both rings dropping together, the dropped count read while a block writes, no allocation on the realtime side, a ramp through a real block across a stop and a start, each chunk stamped with the capture latency its block tells, a chunk split at the ring's end dated by its own first frame); the latency model's units (`latency_spa.hpp`: a peer's triple to frames, what a block tells in rate units) and its parallel combine checked against PipeWire's own `spa_latency_info_combine` and `_finish` on the same peers, unit by unit, mixed units inside PipeWire's bound; a companion's latency beyond an inside bank added in series to its peers' (a real receiver's buffer told whole on `stream`); level windows; the main-loop executor and the watchdog; the PipeWire spikes kept as regressions; the quantum floor and limit at the block size (a node forcing a larger or a smaller quantum changes no cycle), no clock property on a card or a receiver, and a card's ALSA period size and count; sound cards through a test ALSA card (alsa-lib's file and null PCMs, made clockless); RTP receivers fed by a test sender on 127.0.0.1 (senders at 44.1 and 96 kHz resampled); ear's own engine log |
| `ear_server_tests` | Port 7777 on real sockets with a fake main loop and gateway: files, Host and Origin, round trips, the 1008 bound, a client that resets, stop with 1001, levels |
| `ear_system_tests` | The real `out/ear` on an `ear.conf`, reading its records: white noise recorded to the routed channel only, every line a record with `seq` unbroken; old port names refused; folders it cannot make; the graph file end to end (editor edits written back, hand edits winning, typos, symlinks, `@include`, boots that run nothing); an `rtp` node's tone recorded channel for channel; `sendspin` against the real server (pairing, a ramp frame for frame, identity across restarts, floods, mDNS, a lost server); the control port (edits heard in the WAV, levels, errors, stop); the node lifecycle across restarts of ear, on a shared `disabled` value, on the test card and on a held UDP port (a still record, then the receiver's deadline failing the node) |
| web (Vitest, `make web-test`) | The editor's logic against every `test/protocol` fixture ([editor.md](editor.md#developing-it)) |
